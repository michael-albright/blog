                <strong>Kalalau Trail</strong><br />
                The Kalalau Trail provides the only land access to this part of the rugged coast. The trail traverses 5
                valleys before ending at Kalalau Beach where it is blocked by sheer, fluted pali. The 11-mile trail is
                graded but almost never level as it crosses above towering sea cliffs and through lush valleys. The
                trail drops to sea level at the beaches of Hanakāpīʻai and Kalalau.

                <strong>Hanalei Bay</strong><br />
                Hanalei Pier is located at the mouth of the Hanalei River. This section of beach fronts Black Pot Beach
                Park, a popular camping area for local families. There is a small boat ramp where you can launch kayaks
                to paddle the Hanalei River. Hanalei Pier is where you will find the calmest spot for children to play
                in the surf.

                The Historic Hanalei Pier is a popular landmark that at one time was used as a busy working pier used to
                load and off load sugar and other goods to and from ships. The pier was originally built of wood before
                1892. In 1912 it was lengthened to 340 feet, but the wooden deck proved difficult to maintain in the
                tropical climate. In 1921 the legislature authorized $25,000 for a concrete deck. Conney and Morris were
                selected as contractors, and the work was completed by the end of 1922.

                <strong>Wailua Falls</strong><br />
                If you've ever fantasized about seeing a double-tiered waterfall, then get ready to turn your fantasy
                into reality at the gorgeous Wailua Falls. And speaking of fantasy, Wailua Falls is so lovely that it
                was featured in the opening scene of the long-running TV show Fantasy Island.

                There are several reasons Wailua Falls is such a great (and popular) place for visitors to enjoy. First,
                it was catapulted into the international spotlight back in the 1970's by the well-known television
                series. It has also been widely utilized in print and other forms of media for decades as a symbol of
                Kauai's lush beauty. Second, unlike many other Kauai waterfalls, Wailua Falls is easily accessible, as
                no hiking is needed to reach it and appreciate its beauty up close. In fact, the parking lot basically
                overlooks the falls. But the main reason the falls is so special is its beauty; it has certainly earned
                its place as an international representation of Kauai's enchantment.

                As an added bonus, when the sun hits at just the right angle you'll get a beautiful rainbow extending
                out from the base of the falls in the mist, which is nothing short of spectacular.

                <strong>Anini Beach/strong</strong><br />
                Anini Beach is popular for camping and also a great beach for simply relaxing with a book, fishing from
                shore or paddle boarding above the lively reef. The deeper and clearer water can be enticing, but it is
                better to be cautious and stay closer to shore.

                Anini Beach is usually less crowded than Poipu or Hanalei and is really quite breathtaking. The Beach
                Park has multiple campsites with permits, shade trees, picnic tables, pavilions, restrooms and showers.

                <strong>Koke State Park</strong><br />
                There are seven major hiking trails in Koke’e State Park:

                Alakai Swamp Trail
                Awaʻawapuhi Trail
                Kawaikoi Stream Trail
                Nuʻalolo Cliffs Trail
                Nuʻalolo Trail
                Pihea Trail
                Poomau Canyon Lookout Trail
                Along the way, hikers can expect to see lush, native vegetation, views of the ocean, and native birds.
                Kalalau Valley can also be seen from the park – this was the backdrop for Jack London’s short story
                Koʻolau the Leper.

                Stop by the Koke’e Natural History Museum for current trail information and maps.

                <strong>Snorkeling North Shore</strong><br />
                Tunnels Beach is for the more experienced snorkelers and scuba divers. Located near the YMCA camp
                between Hanalei and Haena on Kauai's north shore, "Tunnels" gets its name from a labyrinth of underwater
                lava tubes, canyons, and pathways that support a wide variety of colorful sea life. The shallow reef is
                protected by an even larger reef further out. Although no facilities are located here, the beach is
                spectacular and very picturesque.
